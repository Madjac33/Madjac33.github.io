        <p>The wetlands are home to a variety of creatures. Geese and other waterfowl inhabit the Delaware Water Gap wetlands. There are also different shorebirds like the ruddy turnstone and the sandpiper. </p>
        <p>Plenty of reptiles call the wetlands their home. Among these animals are bog turtles, painted turtles, water snakes, garter snakes, and ribbon snakes. Many amphibians also find shelter in the wetlands. Some examples are the green frog, the spring peeper, the eastern newt, and the spotted salamander.</p>
        <p>There are many mammals that live near the water because it provides a source of food. These animals typically eat smaller amphibians, reptiles, and fish that populate the wetlands. Although they are hard to find, minks, muskrats, and otters can be spotted in the Delaware Water Gap wetlands.</p>
