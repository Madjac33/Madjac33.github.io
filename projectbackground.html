            <p>This project was inspired by a visit to Trentoniana in the Trenton Public Library. There, I found a copy of <i>New Jersey Out-of-Doors: A History of its Flora and Fauna</i> signed by the author Leonard Lee Rue III. The book details the different creatures that had been identified in the state before the early 60s as well as where you might find them.<br><br>The Delaware Water Gap is a topic of discussion in the book. It's also in close proximity with Trenton, New Jersey. So, I hope this project will be able to provide an interactive interface where Trenton residents can learn a little bit about their home. This project is also intended to pay homage to the esteemed naturalist Leonard Lee Rue III.</p>
